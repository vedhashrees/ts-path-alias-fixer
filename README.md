```

## Usage

### CLI Usage

#### General

Run the CLI tool from your project root (or specify a directory):

```bash
npx fix-ts-imports
```

or if installed globally:

```bash
fix-ts-imports
```

### CLI Options

| Options     |                   Descriptions                    |        Default         |
| ----------- | :-----------------------------------------------: | :--------------------: |
| -d, --dir   |              Project root directory               | ./ (Current directory) |
| -a, --alias |       Alias to replace relative paths with        |           @            |
| -b, --base  |     Base folder inside the project to replace     |          src           |
| --dry-run   | Show which files would be modified without saving |         false          |

## Example Usage:

In your project, if there are files which has relative path imports which needs to be modified to use custom path alias as below

Let's say it should convert:

```bash
import { greet } from '../utils/helpers';
```

To:

```bash
import { greet } from '@/utils/helpers';
```

## Run with `dry-run` option:

In your project, before modifying your existing files by using this tool, if you want to check and understand what files will get affected

#### Preview changes without modifying files:

```bash
npx fix-ts-imports --dry-run
```

#### Run with custom options:

```bash
npx fix-ts-imports --dir ./src --alias @ --base src --dry-run
```

## Example Output

Once you run the cli command as above with dry-run, you should see some output console logs which will indicate how many files would be modified with custom path alias imports and what are their file paths in your project as below

```bash
üîç Dry run: 3 file(s) would be modified.
 - src\index.ts
 - src\utils\helper.ts
 - src\api\v1\index.ts
```

## Run to modify files:

If you are happy with the `--dry-run` output and want to proceed with the file changes in your project, run this tool as below

```bash
npx fix-ts-imports
```

or

```bash
npx fix-ts-imports --dir ./ --alias @ --base src
```

## Example Output

Once you run the cli command as above, you should see some output console logs which will indicate how many files have been modified with custom path alias imports in our project

```bash
‚úÖ Imports fixed in 3 file(s).
```
